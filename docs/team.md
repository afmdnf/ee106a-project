## Eric Hu

Eric is currently a fourth-year BioE undergraduate student, also pursuing an EECS minor. He has previously taken E7, CS 61B, EE 16A/B, EE 120, and several upper-division design classes in the BioE and ME departments. He has experience programming and designing electronics for small-scale projects, and is an avid debugger/troubleshooter of both software and hardware, from his experience with competition robotics.

Eric worked closely with Fayyaz, helping to implement all of the processes involving computer vision. This includes connecting the TF trees of the Baxter and RealSense using a common AR tag, isolating objects from the table using thresholding and pointcloud segmentation, implementing contour detection to determine the number of objects, and using PCA to determine the type and orientation of each object. He also assisted the actuation team with developing a method to process wrist camera images, to perform visual servoing.

## Mohammed Shaikh

Mohammed is a fourth-yeah EECS undergraduate student. He has taken EE 16AB, EE 120 and most CS upper division courses such as CS 162, CS 188, CS 189. His primary expertise is in programming and design of software systems.

Mohammed worked with Naser on the grasping and actuation aspect of the project, including processing the transforms from the vision team for path planning, visual servo and ensuring object pickup reliability.
