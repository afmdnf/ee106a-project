# Team Members

## Naser Abdelrahman

Naser is a graduating third-year BioE undergraduate student concentrating in medical devices. He is particularly passionate about automation and robotics. Naser has taken numerous signals and systems classes including BioE 105, BioE 101, and BioE C145B and has extended experience designing CAD models and fabricating assemblies.

Naser worked with Mohammed on the grasping and actuation aspect of the project, including processing the transforms from the vision team for path planning, visual servo and ensuring object pickup reliability.

## Fayyaz Ahamed

Fayyaz is a fourth-year BioE undergraduate student. He has previously taken CS 61A and the BioE equivalents of EE 16A/B, is concurrently taking EE 120, and has taken several upper-division BioE classes in biomedical devices and imaging. He has prior image analysis and CAD experience from his time in the Kurhanewicz Lab at UCSF.

Fayyaz worked closely with Eric to implement all of the computer vision processes. He helped out with the implementation of color thresholding in the HSV color space, the static transform publisher that connects the TF trees of the Baxter and Realsense, PCA to classify types and orientation of kitchenware, and writing the custom messages and publisher that send object type and transform to baxter. He also assisted the actuation team test and improve reliability of the various pickup protocols.

## Eric Hu

Eric is currently a fourth-year BioE undergraduate student, also pursuing an EECS minor. He has previously taken E7, CS 61B, EE 16A/B, EE 120, and several upper-division design classes in the BioE and ME departments. He has experience programming and designing electronics for small-scale projects, and is an avid debugger/troubleshooter of both software and hardware, from his experience with competition robotics.

Eric worked closely with Fayyaz, helping to implement all of the processes involving computer vision. This includes connecting the TF trees of the Baxter and RealSense using a common AR tag, isolating objects from the table using thresholding and pointcloud segmentation, implementing contour detection to determine the number of objects, and using PCA to determine the type and orientation of each object. He also assisted the actuation team with developing a method to process wrist camera images, to perform visual servoing.

## Mohammed Shaikh

Mohammed is a fourth-yeah EECS undergraduate student. He has taken EE 16AB, EE 120 and most CS upper division courses such as CS 162, CS 188, CS 189. His primary expertise is in programming and design of software systems.

Mohammed worked with Naser on the grasping and actuation aspect of the project, including processing the transforms from the vision team for path planning, visual servo and ensuring object pickup reliability.
