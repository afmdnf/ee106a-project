Our robot is able to locate, navigate and pick up our desired object (cup, plate, spoon/fork) with great reliability. The system is designed to be continuous in nature where any number of supported objects can be placed in the workspace and the robot would be able to identify, pick up the objects in order and place them in a sorted manner, without any human intervention!
